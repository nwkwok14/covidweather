Effect of Ambient Temperature on COVID-19 Testing 
Nicholas Kwok, MD 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center

This project uses beta regression to evaluate the relationship at the county level between maximum daily ambient temperature and COVID-19 test positivity rate, when adjusted for COVID-19 prevalence, county population, day of week, and county. 
All required data files are in the Data folder. Raw data is contained in the CSV files. For convenience, RDS files with variables contained imported data can also be used instead. 
All required functions are in the Functions folder. 
Please use script tempCOVIDmixedmodel.R and R version 2023.12.0 to run the analysis.
